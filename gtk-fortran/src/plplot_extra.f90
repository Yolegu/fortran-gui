module plplot_extra
  implicit none

  ! Interface for the PLplot pl_cmd() routine, not available
  ! in the Fortran binding, but in the plplot.h header file:
  interface
    ! Front-end to driver escape function. In principle this can be used
    ! to pass just about anything directly to the driver:
    subroutine pl_cmd(cmd, arg) bind(c)
      use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding, only: c_int, c_ptr
      ! A PLESC command to pass to the driver:
      integer(c_int), value :: cmd
      ! Data associated with the cmd command:
      type(c_ptr), value :: arg
    end subroutine pl_cmd
  end interface
end module plplot_extra
